    <h1>Project Proposal: RememberME</h1>

    <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
    <p>In today’s fast-paced world, maintaining meaningful personal relationships can be challenging. One common but often overlooked struggle is remembering the birthdays of friends and family, along with thoughtful details like their favorite interests, hobbies, or preferences. Missing a loved one’s birthday or sending a generic message may seem small, but it can strain emotional connections and make relationships feel less personal.</p>

    <p><strong>RememberME</strong> is a web application designed to solve this problem by providing users with timely birthday reminders and personalized updates about the people they care about. By combining event notifications with interest-based insights, the app helps users stay intentional and engaged in their relationships.</p>

    <p>Currently, platforms like <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> offer birthday reminders, but they don’t provide deeper context—such as what a person might currently enjoy or want—making wishes feel last-minute or robotic. Calendar apps track dates but lack connection-building features. Other tools like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.niceringapps.hip" target="_blank">Hip</a> or Greeting Cards & Wishes focus on reminders but miss personalization. RememberME stands out by giving users both reminders and curated, meaningful suggestions based on shared data.</p>

    <h2>App Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> RememberME is a web-based app that helps users remember their friends' birthdays and recommend meaningful gift ideas. Users can create an account, store info about their friends, and get timely reminders. This system supports emotional connection by making birthdays feel personal, not just another date on the calendar.</p>

    <p><strong>Users:</strong> The app is designed for people who want to be thoughtful but may struggle with memory or time—especially busy students, working adults, or long-distance friends. It will be simple and inclusive, with easy-to-use features that also consider accessibility for different groups.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Friend data storage:</strong> Users can log in and add information about their friends—like birthdays, gender, relationship type, and interests.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Gift recommendations:</strong> The app will suggest birthday gift ideas using an external API based on that friend’s profile.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Dashboard reminders:</strong> Users will see alerts on the homepage reminding them about upcoming birthdays, and also will add a feature can send email to the user to remind them, helping them plan ahead.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Data:</strong> All the data will be user-generated and stored for later use. While we may explore APIs for gift suggestions, we’ll avoid those requiring server-side authentication. We’ve tested potential APIs with <a href="https://joelwross.github.io/cors-test/" target="_blank">this CORS tool</a> to ensure they can work client-side.</p>

    <p><strong>How it helps:</strong> Instead of relying on generic reminders or struggling to find last-minute gifts, users can proactively prepare something thoughtful. The app gives meaning to birthday interactions and helps users be intentional in their relationships.</p>

    <h2>User Story / Use Case</h2>
    <p>As a busy college student, I often forget the birthdays of my friends and family, especially those who live far away. I want a simple and friendly web app where I can log in, save my friends' birthdays, and get timely reminders when their birthdays are approaching. I’d also like help figuring out what to gift them, especially based on their interests and age.</p>

    <p>With RememberME, I can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log in to a personalized space</li>
      <li>Add or update birthday entries for each friend</li>
      <li>Receive suggestions for birthday gifts tailored to each friend's preferences</li>
      <li>Get a reminder (e.g., via a dashboard alert) a few days before someone’s birthday</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This helps me stay thoughtful and connected with people I care about—without missing important days.</p>
